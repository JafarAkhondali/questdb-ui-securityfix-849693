# QuestDB UI

> Welcome to a WIP repository!
> The code here is not (yet) meant for public use. Beware of dragons!

This repository is a monorepo for QuestDB user interface implementation and tooling.

Currently hosting two packages to help with testing other QuestDB code:

* `screenshot-tests` - a utility based on puppeteer that helps to automate taking screenshots of a website and comparing them between runs
* `browser-tests` - a utility based on cypress that helps to automate interactions and assert zero regressions
